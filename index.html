Dear ${nick},

Congratulations on your recent UK visit. Your ${activity} has left the nation both horrified and highly entertained. Watching you ${detail} was unforgettable, though many are still trying to recover emotionally. 

Of course, we cannot forget your ${style}, which paired wonderfully with your cancelled pub visit and general lack of self-awareness. The locals were undoubtedly relieved. And your comment that "${quote}" will surely live in infamy, alongside your viral antics.  

Watching you navigate this trip ${comparison} has been nothing short of a national spectacle. Perhaps next time, consider quieter hobbies: birdwatching, knitting, or lounging on a couch in Ohio.

${memeHTML}

With the utmost “admiration” for your dedication to confounding the world,
